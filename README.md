Implemented an interpreter for a subset of Linux Shell commands

In this project, I’ve implemented an interpreter for a subset of Linux Shell commands.

I’ve used C Language for programming and used gcc compiler in Linux environment. 

My interpreted reads commands from the keyboard, parses the command into its tokens and display the tokens, the process the command and waits for the new command using the parse table.

The commands are 
-echo
-cp
-wc
-cat
-expr.
